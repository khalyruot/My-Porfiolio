  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <div class="button1">
      <p class="name1">
        Hello! My name is Khaly Ruot. I grew up in Cambodia, and moved to the United States for pursuing my education. This page will show the journey of my life. This website will include my background, education, professional, and hobbies in my daily life.

        As an immigrant, I started off my life in the US way below the bottom. During my first 2 years in the states, I went to English as Second Language class, and then proceeded to get my GED education before going to college. I went to school at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. I graduated from the Mechanical Engineering department in August 2019. 

        Please feel free to there explore the website while I am trying to update my daily activies as much as possible.
